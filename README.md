## Overview
In this project, we analyze customer sentiment toward various products and companies using a Twitter-based dataset titled **“judge-1377884607_tweet_product_company.”**
The dataset contains tweets mentioning specific companies, product categories, and corresponding sentiment labels, making it useful for understanding customer perception and brand performance.

Using data cleaning, text preprocessing, feature engineering, sentiment visualization, and exploratory analysis, we identify key factors that influence public opinion across different companies and products. Our analysis reveals which brands receive the most positive or negative sentiment, the products associated with the highest complaint volumes, and the common themes in customer feedback.

The insights from this project help businesses understand how customers perceive their products on social media and guide data-driven decisions in marketing, product improvement, and customer experience strategy. We conclude with three actionable recommendations based on sentiment patterns that can help companies improve brand reputation and strengthen customer satisfaction

##Business Understanding:
In the digital era, customers constantly express opinions on social media, especially on platforms like Twitter. These posts reveal how people feel about brands, their products, and their customer experience.
Companies increasingly rely on sentiment analysis to monitor public perception, identify dissatisfaction early, and guide marketing, product design, and support decisions.

The **“judge-1377884607_tweet_product_company”** dataset fits into this real-world business need. It contains tweets, the product mentioned, and the company associated with each tweet. Most versions of this dataset also include or infer sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

###Problem Statement
Brands invest massive resources in marketing at major events like SXSW, but they lack a real-time, data-driven understanding of public perception. They struggle to answer:

- Is our campaign resonating positively?
- How does sentiment towards our brand compare to our competitors?
- What specific product features or marketing stunts are people talking about (good or bad or neutral)?

### Stakeholders
**1. Marketing Directors at Tech Companies (e.g., Apple, Google):**

“Do we double down on this activation or cut our losses?”
“Which competitor is heating up right now?”
“What messaging is actually resonating with the audience?”
2. Brand Strategy Consultants:

"Need actionable competitive intelligence for client advising."

“What is our true position vs competitors?”
“What emerging trends should we capitalize on?”
“Where are the market gaps we can own?”
3. For a CMO After SXSW

“What should we change for next year?”
“How should we allocate our next event budget?”
